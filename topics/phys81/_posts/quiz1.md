# Quiz 1: Measurement

1. Energy Conservation. Assume there are 20 million passenger vehicles in the philippines and that the average fuel consumption is 8.5km/L of fuel. If the average distance traveled by each vehicle is 10000km/yr, how much fuel would be saved per year if average fuel consumption could be increased to 12km/L(efficient cars)? If fuel sells at 50.00 pesos/L, what is the cost of the savings per year?

   

$$
20 \text{million vehicles} \cdot \frac{10000km}{yr} = 2\cdot 10^{-11}\frac{km}{yr}\\
\frac{2\times 10^{11} \frac{km}{yr}}{8.5 \frac{km}{L}} = 2.35 \times 10^{10} \frac{L}{yr}\\
\frac{2\times 10^{11} \frac{km}{yr}}{12 \frac{km}{L}} = 1.67 \times 10^{10} \frac{L}{yr}\\
$$



Therefore the fuel saved is
$$
6.9 \times10^{9} \frac{L}{yr}
$$
Cost savings is
$$
6.9 \times10^{9} \frac{L}{yr} \times 50 \frac{pesos}{L} = 343 \text{ billion pesos}
$$


2. Water Pollution. When a dorplet of oil spreads out on a smooth water surface, the resulting "oil slick" is approximately one molecule thick. An oil droplet of mass $9.00 \times 10^{-7}$ kg and density $918kg/m^{3}$ spreads out into a circle of radius 41.8 cm on the water surface. What is the diameter of an oil molecule.

$$
V = \frac{9.00\times 10^{-7}kg}{918 \frac{kg}{m^{3}}} = 9.80 \times 10^{-10}m^{3}
$$


$$
\begin{align*} 
 \pi r^{2}d &=  9.80 \times 10^{-10}m^{3}\\
d &=  \frac{9.80 \times 10^{-10}m^{3}}{\pi (41cm * \frac{1\times 10^{-2}m}{m})^{2}}\\
d &\approx 1.79 \times 10^{-9}m  
\end{align*}
$$
