**Perspective:**

- view relative to position
- requires closer look

**System:**

- set of things working together
- an interconnecting network

Looking how people in the past view systems  and how it progresses overtime

### 1.3 Living Systems in Oral Traditions

##### **How did our ancestors understand Living Systems?**

Through Systemic observations and experiential learning

- Immediate environment became the source of all their needs
- Knowledge go the environment was a matter of life and death for them

##### **How was knowledge transmitted?**

- Orally - Stories and music
- Visual Arts
- Experientially - Direct teaching younger generations in hunting and gathering, taking nature walks, rituals and dream journeys

> Austin Hackney (2018) - In most cultures……

##### **Whose experiences in the tribe are passed on, recorded and stored?**

These people are responsible for the creation, recording and teaching of knowledge for the survival of the tribe.

- Elder - esteemed for their knowledge
- Storyteller - with the ability to tell stories in a memorable, engaging way, performs an important teaching function in the life of a tribe
- Hunter - knowledge of wildlife and capability to create tools and weapons
- Gatherer - knowledge of herbs, animals and fruits and their uses
- Farmer - knowledge of seasons and the signs of the sky and wind

**Stories**, **myths** and l**egends** are how the tribe records and stores it’s experiences

According to “Ancient References” Farmers are mostly women because farming is domesticated and safer. This means they would be able to take care of their children.

### 1.3.1. Indigenous Knowledge, Systems and Practices (IKSP)

Biocultural Knowledge -> IKSPs -> Knowledge of geography the natural and physical world

**Biocultural knowledge** is knowledge that is rooted both in the natural environment and what is readily available, at the same time grounded on the culture – values and norms -- of the people who hold it. 

**IKSPs** are tested and re-tested for thousands of years in the most rigorous real-life laboratories for survival and well-being; and recently thru modern scientific methods

**Knowledge of geography, the natural and physical world** 

* translated to art and oral literature
* accurate prediction of future environmental conditions (e.g. weather) 
* allowed them to invent technologies that relate to domestication, herbal-based medicines, forms of clothing and transportation, astronomy, sustainable agricultural and industrial practices



**CASE STUDIES :** https://web.archive.org/web/20190913084716/http://www.unesco.org/education/tlsf/mods/theme_c/mod11.html?panel=1

##### **1. A SPIRITUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LAND**

- Indigenous people consider the earth as a parent, “Mother Earth” connects with their past (home of ancestors), present (providing material needs) and future (legacy for children).
- The land is the source of life nourishing, supporting and teaching.
- Indigenousness carries a sense of belonging to a place, a **sense of connectedness** where all things are woven together with sacred meaning.
- Land belonging to someone despite being unused, uncared or uninhabited is a foreign concept to indigenous people.
- In the “developed-world” land is owned by private individuals, corporate investors or the state, while for indigenous people, land is **owned collectively** by the community.
- Indigenous law says that humans are merely trustees of the the land, and have a **collective responsibility to preserve it**.
- Indigenous people do not view land as an economic resource, unlike the predominant Western world view where it must be studied, dissected, extracted of secrets and wealth.
- Their way of life is developed and defined in relationship to the environment around them. They adjust to the environment and not the other way around. 

​    

**Penan of Rural Brunei**

- “Molong” concept of natural resource conservation. It is a sense of caring and stewardship over forest resources. 
- Responsible and moderate use of forest for preservation for future generations. 
- Greed has no place for the Penan.
  - Example. When harvesting sago or rattan, they only take the mature stems, and leave the young shoots for future harvesting.
  - They respect *diptercorp trees* which produce seeds that wild boars eat.
  - They also don’t pollute the river because they **know** that wild boars also eat plants that grow riverside.
  - Boars are given their share of sago trees. 
  - Protect acorn-producing trees that boars also love.
- Fear people who cut the trees indiscriminately because they think it might decrease their food supply.
- The forest is their world, they live in harmony with it and guard it tenaciously.
- The forest is everything to them because they realise it provides food, building materials, medicines and raw materials for handicrafts.

**Kedayan of Rural Brunei**

- Survived by carefully utilising the forest, land and wildlife.
- Utilise and extract forest resource by day-to-day activities of agriculture and hunting. Practicing this way of life through many generations.
- Use complex and highly adaptive systems.
  - Cultivation of hill
  - Swamp rice
  - To cultivate staple foods and rice, they use both shifting & permanent agricultural techniques, depending on type of padi (tugal, payi, hambur and  tanam)
- Well into the 20th century, they were traditionally shifting agriculturists, felling, burning????? and planting hill padi in successive hillsides.
  - Example areas are the very rural parts of Temburong, such as Kampong Piasaw-Piasaw.
- They haven’t over-exploited and misused their forest environments, evidence is that a large part of Temburong is still covered with forests.
- The harmonising and systematic use of the environment (land & forest) allowed them to practise economic activities (food production and manufacturing of materials) through many generations. They are also able to sell surplus to other non-agricultural people.
- **WHAT I LEARNED:** Basically, they were careful on how they exploited the environment, they probably used sustainable methods of resource gathering so that could collect more resources in the long run. 

##### **2. NATURAL REMEDIES AND MEDICINES**

- Indigenous people classify soils, climate, plant and animal species and recognise it’s special characteristics.
- They have names for plants and insects that have not yet been identified by botanists and entomologists.
  - Philippine’s Hanunoo people distinguish 1600 plant species, 400 more than scientist.
  - The estimated 250 - 500 k plant species in the world, more that 85% exists in environments where indigenous people live. 
  - Nearly 75% of 121 plant-derived prescription drugs were discovered from indigenous medicines.
  - Indigenous people have 3000 different species of plants to control fertility.
  - Kallaywayas (Wandering healers of bolivia) use 600 medicinal herbs.
  - Traditional healers in Southeast Asia use 6500 plants for drugs
- Scientists believe that indigenous knowledge may help discover cures for diseases like AIDS and cancer.
- Indigenous medicines are **available locally, cultural acceptable and cheaper**.

**Medicinal plants in India**

- Aside from physical symptoms, medicinal plants are also used to treat spiritual origins of disease.
- Botanical survey revealed that north-east tribal people use plants to cure **fevers, bronchitis, blood** and **skin disease, eye infections, lung** and  **spleen ulcers, diabetes** and high blood pressure. 
- Knowledge is passed by “**Vaiyas**”, indian herbal medicine doctors.
- Kameng and Lohit people crush Fritillaria cirrhosa to relieve muscle pain. This is confirmed by research.
- 3000 plants are used as contraceptives.
  - Karjat tribal area of Maharashtra uses a native herb twice a year and is said to be effective.
- The Karjat study also conclude that traditional health practices can provide up to half of local primary health needs.
- Health-care workers are reintroducing traditional plant remedies.

##### **3. SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT**

- The industrial world (us) is facing an ecological crisis.
- Industrial economies won’t admit that we can from indigenous people, their economy is called “primitive” and technologies as “Stone-Age”.
- Traditional ways of life have proven to be highly durable.
  - Inuit survive the Artic through hunting and fishing.
  - Nomadic pastoralism provide for people in Sahelian region of Africa.
  - Shifting cultivation in the Amazon and forests of South-East Asia.
- Non-indigenous people (like me) cannot survive in extreme conditions without destroying the balance of the ecosystem.
- **SUSTAINABILITY IS THE KEY!!!!!**
- Indigenous people use available resources without depleting them.
- They use their intimate knowledge of the environment to co-exist with nature, not to exploit it.
- Careful management, control of population, use of small quantities but wide diversity small surpluses and minimum wastage.
- Indigenous knowledge focuses not on exploitation but on harmony of the natural world.

**Karen of Thailand**

- Shifting cultivation is sustainable economic system that doesn’t harm the environment.
  - Practised by indigenous people of Asia and lowland Latin America.
  - Provides economic independence and cultural integrity.
  - Low population density and sufficient land, it is successful way of using forest.
- The Karen people’s economy is almost exclusively on subsistence dry rice production.
  - Area is cleared of trees.
  - Undergrowth is burned.
  - Rice is planted than harvested.
  - Each year a new site is chose and cycles every seven years.
  - This permits regeneration of forest and thin tropical soils
- Money has no place in the community, food determines prosperity.
- Income is used to buy rice.

##### **4. SUSTAINABLE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS**

- Social cohesion is key to the survival of indigenous groups.
- Mutual support and co-operation.
- Men and women have developed complementary, if not equal roles.
- Political decisions are made by consensus.
- Marriage is an integral part of the social, political, economic and spiritual system.
  - In Thailand, a Hmong groom must pay a high dowry, but the wife becomes a member of the husband's clan.
  - It ensures political stability for the community
  - Marriage is prohibited between the same kin group; in others only within the kin group.
  - Traditional societies rarely have marriages founded on the bond of romantic love.
  - Nuclear family is rare, the sense of belonging is tradition.
- Some traditions control having children with laws, helping to keep the population stable.
  - Melanesia, children are adopted to rebalance the size of families.
- Physical architecture of village reflects social structure.
  - West Papua (Irian Jaya), the chief’s home is separated to emphasise social hierarchy.
  - Karen of Thailand, have household autonomy and social equity, therefore they have no village centre and live in similar houses.

**Maori of Aotearoa (New Zealand)**

- Justice system with highly developed oratory.
  - No codified set of laws, courts and judges.
- Traditional Maori justice was based on material and spiritual worlds.
  - Minor offences was determined by community.
  - Serious ones by elders or chiefs.
- Punishment is exacted by transfer of goods known as ‘**utu**’, or satisfaction, to the injured party.
- Persistent theft or murder is punishable by ‘**muru**’ or plunder.
  - Done only after formal discussion with reference to customary principles.
- Other offenders receive a beating, withdrawal of community assistance or worst, banishment.
- Chiefs with spiritual powers use conserve parts of the forest for a feast.
- Access to land was prohibited and could anger the spirits.

**Papua New Guinea (THE PURGE BUT NO FIGHTING)**

- Rather than starting a war, aggression is normally channelled into a ritualised process of war-making and long-term destruction is minimal.

- Hostilities between groups are a part of the cycle of events encompassing peace and enmity.

- War is a cultural aspect of life.

- War is how they find the group’s identity and is largely ceremonial.

  - Tsembaga and Mae Enga marry their enemies.

- War can be started by theft, poaching or killing someone’s pig or disputes over territory and resources.

- The “Big Man”, may avoid war by compensation or exchange of gifts, but cannot impose a decision.

- Individuals don’t resolve conflicts on their own but rather is done by the whole group.

- Anger may be channelled into shouting and insulting or else may lead to a real fight.

- After war, peace-making begins.

- Recorded astronomical data to keep time and predict weather. 

##### **How is knowledge transmitted?**

- Writing and the ability for knowledge **production**, **transmission** and **storage**.

**Who are the key people with power over the production, transmission, and storage of knowledge?**

**Priestly Class**

- sole interpreters of the gods’ desires
- exclusive access to the stored knowledge
- controlled political power, including surplus production
- knowledge was in their hands

### 1.4.1 Sumerians and their knowledge of Biology (4500 - 1750 BCE)

##### **Knowledge of biology**

- Sumerians live in the southern part of what is now Iraq
- Heartland of Sumer between the Euphrates and Tigris, was called Mesopotamia
- Sumers where called black haired people
- “Sumer” is the land of civilised lords
- Considered creators of civilizations
- Known for their innovations in language, governance, architecture and more

Oldest scientific report about biology?

**Belief System** - encompassed both empirical and magical.

- Only way to heal someone is to do animal sacrifice.
- Some diseases were attributed to demon possession. 
- Sumerians didn’t worship their kings as a god.
- Shamash - Sun God, to connect animals and health of humans.

------

### 1.4.2. Greek Philosophers and their Theories (800 - 300 BCE)

**History of biology** usually traces the beginnings of abstract scientific thought attributed to Greek Philosophers.

Methods used by philosophers are similar to indigenous people, where the use **experience**, **meditation** and **learned intuition** to understand the nature of things. However, there is little experimentation.

##### TOP 10 ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHERS

**Parmenides**

- Matter is the manifestation of indivisibility

**Anaxagoras**

- Matter is infinitely divisible
- Matter would be motionless unless animated by mind

**Anaximander**

- Life started with water
- Men originated from fish 
- Earth is spherical

**Empedocies**

- 4 Elements
  - Earth
  - Wind 
  - Fire
  - Water
- Intermingling of elements depends on love, conflict and strife

**Zeno**

- Student of parmenides

**Pythagoras**

- Pythagorean theorem
- Sun, moon and stars circular motions

**Socartes**

- Socratic Method
- Engage in dialogue 

**Plato**

- Theories of ideas and forms
- Islamic and medieval philosophy

**Aristotle**

- May be the first biologist in Western tradition.
- Devoted his work to the study of living systems.
- **"Great Chain of Being"** 
  - as a classification system, was the major organizing principle and foundation of the emerging science of biology until the 18th century. 

**Thales of Miletus**

- Discovered principles of geometry

##### **The Philosophers answers were sometimes inadequate and often wrong. Why?**

According to stanford, 

> ”Because of its wide range and its remoteness in time, Aristotle’s philosophy defies easy encapsulation. The long history of interpretation and appropriation of Aristotelian texts and themes—spanning over two millennia and comprising philosophers working within a variety of religious and secular traditions—has rendered even basic points of interpretation controversial. ”

### 1.4.3 Medieval Europe and the " Golden Age" of the Islamic Civilization

##### **Golden age of Civilisations**

- economic expansion
- military strength
- technological development

##### **Medieval Period**

- Fall of rome - beginning of renaissance.

- **Feudal** and **hierarchical.**

  - concerned with production of food and goods

- Seeking and using knowledge was relegated to a select few who knew how to read and write.

- Knowledge and its interpretation were proscribed by a ruling class. 

  - Monarchies
  - Church

- Knowledge had to pass through the censure of the Church.

  - Ideas which did not conform were regarded as hearsay.
  - Those who tried to explain miracles and other matters of faith faced harsh punishment. 

   

A resurgence of interest in gaining knowledge in Europe helped in advancing the creation of centers of learning outside the monasteries: the **University**.

Throughout Europe, **traditional authority was questioned** and the new scholars embraced the notion that humanity could be improved **not only through prayer and good works, but through rational change**.

### 1.4.4. The European Enlightenment: The hypothetical-deductive method and democratising knowledge

Aristotelian thought was the dominant view for a millennium in the West. 

However, descartes’ arguments proved to be most convincing in the European continent. 



##### **Cartesian Hypothetical-Deductive Methodology**  or “Scientific Method”

- Methodology with an unprecedented analytical power in terms of hypothesizing underlying mechanisms behind phenomena and a means of verifying these hypotheses. 
- Understanding mechanism of living systems veered away from spiritual and magical causes.

------

### 1.5. Living Systems in the 19th and 20th country

##### **Reductionist Science/Philosophy**

- analyses a larger system by breaking it down into pieces and determining the connections between the parts. 
- analyse complex phenomena interns of its simple or fundamental constituents

The capacity to put forward and test various new theories allowed for the growth of the field of Biology. 

**Theory of Evolution**

- Charles Darwin

------

### 1.5.2 Limits of mechanistic and reductionist paradigms

##### Cartesian Analytical Framework

[+] led to **industrial practices** that were very efficient in bring forth its desired outcomes. Cartesian framework uses its analytical power and focus on how to control conditions in order to maximise gains, a useful tool for industrial and economic growth. 

[-] led to many unforeseen consequences to the environment and to human societies

[-] lack safeguards that maintain balance and ensure the sustainability of the industry and the environment of which it is a part

[-] led to the environmental crises that we experience today because of it’s **Utilitarian View of Nature**
