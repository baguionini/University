* Is the esesnce of the living sustems because almost every process important to life (living systems) depends on a steady flow of energy
* evidenced by **motion**, **heat** and **light**

Hence, the cycle of energy is based on the flow of energy through different **trophic levels** in an ecosystem.

>  Trophic originates from greek word, **trophos** meaning to consume

Trophic level is dependent of the consumers and the primary producers



#### Forms of Energy (MRS CHEN)

1. Mechanical
   * Kinetic and potential energy
2. Radiant
   * Energy from the sun
3. Sound
   * Vibrations
4. Chemical
   * Splittings of bonds
   * Chemical reactions
5. Heat
   * Random molecular motion
6. Electrical
   * Charge of electrons
7. Nuclear
   * Splitting of energy in the nucleus



#### Sources of Energy

##### Non-renewable

* cannot be replaced once they are mined, harvested, or used up

  * Examples

    * Minerals

    * Fossil-fuels

      

##### Renewable

* (living and non-living) which can renew themselves **ASSUMING** they are not killed in the process
  * Examples
    * Bioethanol
      * Jatropha curcas (Basin naa sa quiz)
        * Seeds fron dried fruits contain an average of 34.4 percent oil (bioethanol), one of the highest among biofuel crops
  * Non-biological



#### Energy Flow in Living Systems

* Based on the law of thermodynamics

1. Energy in the universe is constant
2. Energy cannot be changed with conversion into heat
   * 2% only used by primary producers



##### How is energy acquired

1. Photosynthesis
2. Chemosynthesis
   * Without use of light
3. Heterotrophs
   * breaking down complex organic molecules



***

#### Some words and their meaning

1. Autotroph 

   * an organism that is able to form nutritional organic substances from simple inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide

     

2. Heterotroph

   * an organism deriving its nutritional requirements from complex organic substances.

3. Primary Producer

   * an organism that make their own food from sunlight and/or chemical energy from deep sea vents, are the base of every food chain

   

4. Consumer

   * an organism that generally obtains food by feeding on other organisms or organic matter due to lack of the ability to manufacture own food from inorganic sources

   

5. Decomposer

   * an organism, especially a soil bacterium, fungus, or invertebrate, that decomposes organic material.

   

6. Photosynthesis

   * the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water

     

7. Chemosynthesis

   * the synthesis of organic compounds by bacteria or other living organisms using energy derived from reactions involving inorganic chemicals, typically in the absence of sunlight.

     

8. Biological Production

   * the total amount of biomass produced by living organisms within a given area in a specific period of time

     

9. Primary Production

   * the production of raw materials for industry.

     

10. Trophic Level

    * each of several hierarchical levels in an ecosystem, consisting of organisms sharing the same function in the food chain and the same nutritional relationship to the primary sources of energy.

      

11. Food Chain

    * a series of organisms each dependent on the next as a source of food.

      

12. Food Web

    * a system of interlocking and interdependent food chains.

      

**Biomass** = drymass + water

#### Flow of energy at different levels of ecosytem

**NOTE:** On the average, only 2% of the total light striking a leaf surface is used to make food through photosynthesis while most of it is transformed as heat.



**Rumen**

* used for digestion of grass



#### How much net enrgy production at one trophic level is passed on to the next level

**10% Rule** 

* of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next trophic level



#### Ecological (trophic) pyramids

**Demonstrated through**

1. Pyramid of numbers
   * Can be inverted
   * Numbers of organisms at each trophic level
2. Pyramid of biomass
   * Can be inverted
   * mass of biological material at each level
3. Pyramid of energy
   * amount of energy passing through each trophic level over a period of time



##### Grazing Food Web

* consists of a base of organisms like plants or other photosynthetic organisms followed by herbivores and various carnivores.



##### Detritus Food Web

* consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter (dead organisms), called decomposers or detritivores.



#### Environment Consequence of Energy Flow

##### Bioaccumulation 

* increase of concentration of pollutant in organism



##### Biomagnification

* increase of concentration of pollutant in food chain





# Biogeochemical Cycle

* Any natural pathway by which essential elements of living matters are circulated



#### CHNOPS

1. Carbon
2. Hydrogen
3. Nitrogen - limiting element
4. Oxygen
5. Phosphorus - limiting element
6. Sulfur



These cycles are **IMPORTANT** because they:

1. enable the transformation of matter from one form to another which enables the utilization of matter in a form specific for a particular organism;
2. enable the transfer of molecules from one locality to another;
3. facilitate the storage of elements;
4. assist in functioning of ecosystems;
5. link living organisms with living organisms and living organisms with abiotic factors; and
6. regulate the flow of substances.
