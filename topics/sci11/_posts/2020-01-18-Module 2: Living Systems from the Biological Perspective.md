**Living systems** involve interactions between living (biotic) and nonliving (abiotic) components to achieve a systems's function or purpose.

* A system is more than the sum of its parts as they are organized into hierarchies with

 increasing complexity.

* A system can involve living (biotic) and nonliving (abiotic) components

  

> “Systems consist of elements or structures, interconnections or interactions that hold the elements together, and a function or purpose that produce their own pattern or behavior over time”

**Meadow (2008)**

**Systems contain these 3 things**

* elements or structure
* interconnections or interactions
* function and purpose





**Biological Law of Specialisation**

* The more highly adapted an organism is to a specific environment the more difficult it is for the orgaism to adapt to a different environment.

#### What differentiates living from non-living systems

##### Properties of Living Systems

###### A. Living systems are organized into hierarchies with progressive specialization of functions and complexity emerging from lower level to higher levels of organization also known as emergent properties.

* **Emergent Properties** are progressive specialization of functions and complexity emerging from lower level to higher levels of organization



**Ecological/Biological Levels of Organization**

1. **Atoms** being the fundamental units of all substances, living or not. Atoms join other atoms to form
2. **Molecules** only living things make the “ molecules of life ”, which are lipids, proteins, DNA, RNA, and complex carbohydrates organized into 
3. **Organelles** which are membrane enclosed structure that perform specific functions to form the
4. **Cell** is the “ basic unit of life ”. Some cells live and reproduce independently while other specific types are organized as
5. **Tissues** organized array of tissues carrying out specific tasks is known as
6. **Organ** set of interacting organs make up the
7. **Organism** is an individual that consists of one ( unicellular) or more cells ( multicellular ). Groups of interbreeding individuals of the same type or species living in a given area constitute the
8. **Population** populations occupying a given area form a
9. **Community** community and the non-living environment function together as an ecological system or
10. **Ecosystem** first unit that is complete because it has all the components necessary for survival.
11. **Biosphere** most inclusive level encompassing all regions of Earth’s crust, waters, and atmosphere in which organisms live.



**Seven Basic Functions (Transcending Factors)  that operates at all levels.**

**1. Energetics**

* Energy and matter conversion; have the ability to manipulate energy and matter

* Ultimate source of energy is the sun

  

**2. Behavior**

* Monarch butterfly females lay their eggs near the **milkweed**

  

**3. Development**

* Development at the level of ecosystem is known as ecosystem development or **succession**

  * an often-predictable way or pattern by which plant and animal communities develop following disturbances

* Primary Succesion???

* Lichen Seeds

  * are a composite plant

    * algae

    * fungus

      

**4. Evolution**

* A result of a living system's responsiveness processes - ability to react to external and internal changes in its environment affecting survival

* **Industrial Melanism**

  

**5. Diversity**

* Patterns of diversity can be seen at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels

  

#### Notes from Video

###### Natural Selection

**Fittest** are the members of a species that are best suited to their environment and therefore merely likely to reproduce



**Selective Pressures**

* Predators

* Food scarcity

* Competition from members of the same species

  

**3 Points of Selection**

* Variation

* Competition

* Heredity

  

**6. Integration**

**7. Regulation**

Mechanisms that ensure that living systems will carry out all activities in the proper sequence (coordination) and at the proper rate (regulation)



***

###### B. Living Systems are largely open systems with **purposes** and **goals**

* Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work.
* Another important property of a living system is that it continues indefinitely within the natural cycles to attain sustainability



Photosynthesis by plants generates a net increase in material quality on Earth. This makes it an **open system** because plants convert **sunlight energy (input)** to chemical energy (stored in food molecules such as sugars), which is used by plants to do work. This energy is then transferred to the higher trophic levels **(consumers)** and is eventually lost from the ecosystem as **heat ( output )**.



**Biogeochemical Cycles**

The cycling of matter from plant to animals through consumption and the breakdown of these matter back to its elemental form through decomposition mostly driven by mircoorganisms to become utilized again by the plants somehow make the living system a relatively closed system. Unutilized decomposed materials become slowly deposited through sedimentation and mineralization and become available again through slow geological cycles such as volcanic eruptions and weathering.

> the cycle in which chemical elements and simple substances are transferred between living systems and the environment



**Feedback Mechanisms**

* Living system forms these to keep the cycle in control

**Goal** is to keep the biogeochemical cycle in control

1. **Negative feedback**

   * increase in input, leads to a decrease in output
   * decrease in input, leads to an increase in output

   

2. **Positive feedback**

   * increase in input, leads to an increase in output
   * Instead of stabilising, it drives it further toward an extreme or another



#### When can a negative feedback become positive but with negative consequences?

* When humans depart from this natural cycle.

  

**"Tragedy of Commons"**

* An economic theory related to sustainability.
* The **“commons”** is any shared and unregulated resource such as water fish stocks, trees and so on.
* Failure of the human society to continue indefinitely within these natural cycles due to greed or self interest will eventually lead to the collapse of the human system.



**The natural system with its self-organizing capacity will persist without humans, but humans cannot live without it.**
