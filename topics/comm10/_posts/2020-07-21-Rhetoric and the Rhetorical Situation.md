### Rhetoric

* the art of using speech to convince or persuade
* "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion" (Aristotle)



### The Study of Rhetoric

* Classic view - trained speakers to be effective persuaders
* Contemporary view - human communication of FUCK



### Rhetoric Defined

* "a mode of altering reality, not bu the direct application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse changes reality through the mediation of thought and action." (Bitzer)

* "the rhetor alters reality by bring into existence a discourse of such a character that the audience in thought and action, is so engaged that it becomes mediator of change." (Bitzer)

  

### Situation as Context

* sit dictates the sorts of obeservations to be made;
* it dictates the significant physical and verbal responses;
* it contrains the words which are uttered in the same sense.
* situation is the vey ground of rhetorical activity.



### Rhetorical Situation

* while the existence of a rhetorical address is a reliable sign of the existence of situation, it does not follow that a situation exists only when the discourse exists.
* it is the situation which calls the discourse into existence.
* a particular discourse comes into existence because of some specific conditon or situation which invites utterance.



### Bitzer's Observation

* Rhetorical discourse comes into existence as a response to situation;
* a speech is given rhetorical significance by the situation;
* a rhetorical situation must exust as a necessary condition of rehtorical discourse;
  * CONTEXT MATTERS!!
* Rhetorical situations mature and decay without giving birth to rhetorical utterance;
  * Situations that occur but do not get attention?
  * prominence matters
  * If it doesn't ilicit a response, then it dies/decays
* a situation is rehtorical insofar as it needs and invites discourse capable of participating with sitation and therby altering its reality;
* a discourse is rhetorical insofar as it functions (of seeks to function) as a fitting response to a situation;
* the situation controls the rhetorical response



### Constituents of Rhetorical Situation

#### Exigence

* the need, demand or requirement instrinsic to a circumstance, condition, etc
* is rhetorical when it is capable pf positive modification and when posivitve modification requires discourse or can be assisted by discourse
* may or may not be percieved clearly by the rhetor or other persons in the situation.
* may be strong or weak depending upon the clarity of their perception and the degree of their interest in it.
* may be such that discourse can completely remove it, or it may persist in spite of repeated modifications.
* when it is perceived and when it is strong and important, then it contrains the thought and action of the perciever who may respond rhetorically if he is in a position to do so.



#### Audience

* rhetoric always requires an audience
* rhetorical audience consist only of those persons who are capable of being influenced by discourse and of being mediators of change
* must be capable of serving as mediator of the change which the discourse function to produce 



#### Constraints

* made of persons,events, objects and relation which have the power to constrain decision and action needed to modify the exigence
* sources of constraint
  * beliefs, attitudes, documents, facts, traditions, images, interests, motives and the like
* classifications: 
  * those originated or managed by the rhetor and his method
  * those other constraints in the situation



# Political Rhetoric

**Condor, Tilleaga, Bilig (2013)**

### Ethos

* appeal to authority or credibility of presenter
* how well the presenter convinces the audience that the presenter is qualified to speak on the subject: being notable in the field, demonstrating mastery, recognition by established authorities.
* 3 categories
  * Phronesis
    * wisdom and practical skilss
  * Arete
    * morality and virtue
  * Eunoia
    * goodwill towards the audience
* framed as a matter of the 'identity' of the communcator which lies at the haert of all persuasive rhetoric
* **Consubstantiality**



### Pathos

* appeal to audience's emotions, imagination and hopes
* most effective when the author or speaker demonstrates agreement with an underlying value of the reader or listener
* being likeable in the simpliest sense



### Logos

* appeal to logic
* can enhance ethos because it is used to describe facts and figures that support the speakers claims





### Strategies

##### Taking and avoiding sides

* to address this problem of diversity, a politician may want to forge advantageous relationships with certain groups during a speech

* candidates can associate themselves with parties catering to the "ordinary people", thus potentially cementing their influence on a broader audience

  

##### Explicity appeals to common in-group membership

* finding or establishing a commonality among diverse audiences.
* "*single rhetorical identity*" has three requirements
  * diverse communities must be regrouped inta single identity category
  * leader's propositions must fulfill the needs of this category
  * leader must present him/herself as a prototypical in-group members



##### Constructing aspiration identities

* By constructing future identities of audience members as more empowered and privileged members of society, the speaker aims to rally the public towards an achievable change



##### Implicit displays of rhetorical alignment

* body posture, paralanguage, and gestures may also contribute to the establishment of a particular identity
* simple use of inclusive pronouns such as "we", "us" and "our" can serve to endear the speaker to audience
